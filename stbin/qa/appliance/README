This is a set of scripts for running wikitests on an appliance.

This wikitest infrastructure is part of the stconfig package.  Install it on an appliance using 'sudo apt-get install stconfig'.  This will install files in /usr/share/nlw/stconfig/stbin/qa/appliance and in /usr/share/nlw/workspaces/wikitests.

cd /usr/share/stconfig/stbin/qa/appliance

Execute 'st-appliance-wikitests' to set up an appliance for wikitests.  You will need sudo.
    
'source ./do-wiki-tests' will run Firefox Testcases with output to file testcases.out from the local wikitests wiki.

Use tail -f testcases.out to observe the run.

'source ./one-wiki-test TESTCASE'   will run one testcase in the current shell

----

HOWTO: observe wikitests running on a custom Selenium platform

Pick a port number (e.g. 5321) and run Selenium 1.0 or later using that port on your Selenium platform. Build an ssh tunnel from your Selenium platform to your appliance:
e.g. 'ssh -R 5321:localhost:5321 qa3.socialtext.net' from your Linux or Mac OSX box, or use Putty to build the tunnel from a Windows box, using port 5321.

in the shell that comes up on your Selenium platform:

'cd /usr/share/stconfig/stbin/qa/appliance'
'source ./setup-selenium PORT BROWSER SERVER_PLATFORM'
examples:
    source ./setup-selenium 5321 firefox linux
    source ./setup-selenium 5321 iexplore windows
    source ./setup-selenium 5321 safari osx
