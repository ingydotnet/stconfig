This is "resume-ie", a small hacky way to get IE to ignore its Javascript
errors when running under Selenium.

Directory content:

    resume-ie.exe - Main executable
    resume-ie.pl  - Source file (not required to run)
    scd10en.exe   - Microsoft Scripting Debugger (install this first)

Instructions:

    1. Run sdc10en.exe if you havn't already installed it on the
       current Windows machine.

    2. Before starting Selenium tests for IE, run resume-ie.exe.
       It will create a console window and keep printing this message:
           Waiting for the [Error] window

    3. Run IE Selenium tests as usual.  When the "Invalid argument" error
       dialog box appears, expect it be auto-closed within 15 seconds.

Notes:

    * You don't need to restart resume-ie.exe between Selenium test runs.
