Stick your personal bash aliases and functions in a file named after your username.

We can refactor commonly used dev and qa aliases out to qa-after and dev-after files
that get sourced by the per-user aliases.


Format:
  <username>-before
  <username>-after


Also, stick your ssh public key in <username>/pub.key and then when this stconfig
package is installed on an appliance, it will be appended to 
~<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys.
